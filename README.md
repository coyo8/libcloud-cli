Apache Libcloud CLI
===================

About
-----
Apache [Libcloud][1] is a standard Python library that abstracts away differences among multiple cloud provider APIs.
Currently Libcloud has a big limitation, you can only use it with Python and you have to write code for each
task, So a CLI for Libcloud will bring up lot of new possibilities to its users and will allow users and system
administrators to perform commonly used operations (listing servers, rebooting servers etc.) easily via
command line without writing a single line of code.
